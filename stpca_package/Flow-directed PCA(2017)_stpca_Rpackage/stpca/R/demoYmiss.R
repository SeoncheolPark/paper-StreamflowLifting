#' Spatiotemporal observations of a single water quality parameter.
#'
#' A demo dataset of a single water quality parameter recorded at regularly
#' spaced time intervals and several monitoring sites, with 15\% of missing
#' values.
#'
#' @format A data.frame with 30 variables (columns, monitoring sites) and 25
#'   observations (rows, time points).  These time points are assumed to be
#'   regularly spaced so could represent weekly/monthly/annual intervals.
#'   \describe{ \item{x1 - x30}{25 regularly spaced temporal observations at
#'   sites x1 - x30} }
